# Maze-Perilous-Real-Time-Implemention-of-Dijkstra-Algorithm

Implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm and k-means clustering for a robot. The tasks are:
1) A autonomous wheeled robot, that has to navigate through the arena, using image processing
2) There will be a mounted usb camera at the centre of the arena, to provide the robot with full coverage of the arena
3) The Task is to use the feed from the camera to guide the robot through waypoints and checkpoints in the arena, and then towards any of the exits, in the shortest time.
